<h3>Roadmap and Changelog</h3>

<p>The current version of the Entities API is 0.0.3 (October 2017) which has support for suggest, retrieval and resolution by external identifier. It is currently available as a Public Alpha, which is the first public version released primarily to get feedback from you. Do note that this means that changes can be introduced which could break backwards compatibility. It also means that to use this API you need a separate API key than for the other Europeana APIs. To see the changes made for the current version and also all previous releases, see the <a href="https://github.com/europeana/entity-api/releases">API changelog in the project GitHub</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Add a search API method allowing for search and listing of (all) entities.</li>
	<li>Support the use of Europeana Search API keys for the Entities API.</li>
	<li>Continuously improve and expand the Entity Collection coverage and information.</li>
</ul>
