<h3>What you need to know in general:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The methods follow as much as possible the Linked Data Platform guidelines together with EDM to format the responses and process the input.</li>
	<li>The "suggest" method retrieves basic information for the named entities that match a given keyword, while the "retrieve" method is meant to access all information about a given entity.</li>
	<li>Supported entity types (ie. EDM classes) are: agent, concept &amp; place.</li>
	<li>All responses are formatted in <a href="/api/entities-getting-started/">JSON-LD</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Request</h3>

<p>Every call to this API is an HTTPS request with the following base URL:</p>

<blockquote style="word-wrap: break-word">https://www.europeana.eu/api/entities/</blockquote>

<h3 id="formats">Supported Output Formats</h3>

<p>This API only supports <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> format, which is the Linked Open Data version of JSON (with the same syntax as JSON). The format for the response does not need to be passed along to the API, if not provided it will fallback to the default.</p>

<!--
<p>You can provide the format either via the URL (extension) or via the "Accept" header. To specify the request and response format you can either do:</p>

<blockquote style="word-wrap: break-word">https://www.europeana.eu/api/entities/suggest.jsonld?wskey=xxxxx&amp;text=*:*</blockquote>

<p>Or:</p>

<blockquote>
Header: "Accept: application/ld+json"<br/>
https://www.europeana.eu/api/entities/suggest?wskey=xxxxx&amp;text=*:*
</blockquote>
-->

<h3 id="api-key">Access key</h3>

<p>To use this API and like most Europeana APIs, you need to supply an API key using the <i>wskey</i> parameter. While in Alpha, the API is only accessible using the <i>apidemo</i> key</p>

<h3 id="error-codes">Error Codes</h3>

<p>An error occurring during processing of an API method is reported by (1) a relevant HTTP status code, (2) a value of the success field and (3) a meaningful error message in the error field. The following table shows the fields appearing within an error response:</p>

<table class="listingtable">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th style="width: 120px">Field</th>
			<th style="width: 100px">Datatype</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>apikey</td>
			<td>String</td>
			<td>The authentication parameter sent out by the client (the wskey parameter)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>action</td>
			<td>String</td>
			<td>The method that was request</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>success</td>
			<td>Boolean</td>
			<td>A boolean (true/false) flag denoting the successful execution of the call</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>error</td>
			<td>String</td>
			<td>If the call was not successful, this fields will contain a detailed text message. See <a href="#error-codes">Error Codes</a> for more information.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>The following kinds of errors can be returned by the API:</p>

<table class="listingtable" id="error-codes">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th style="width: 130px">HTTP<br/>Status Code</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>200</td>
			<td>The request was executed successfully.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>401</td>
			<td>Authentication credentials were missing or authentication failed.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>404</td>
			<td>The requested entity was not found.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>429</td>
			<td>The request could be served because the application has reached its usage limit.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>500</td>
			<td>Internal Server Error. Something has gone wrong, which we will correct.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Content Negotiation</h3>

<h4>Example: Retrieve entity 'Arturo Toscanini' via its persistent URI (which redirects you to the retrieve API method):</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>GET http://data.europeana.eu/agent/base/147466</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Retrieve the same entity directly through the retrieve API method:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/entity/agent/base/147466?wskey=xxxxx</p>
</blockquote>
