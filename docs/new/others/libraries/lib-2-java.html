<h3 id="europeana-java">Europeana java Client library (formerly europeana4j)</h3>

<p>Europeana4j was a Java library which allowed applications to search and retrieve Europeana data. It has since been renamed europeana-client. The java client library allows the functionality of the Europeana API to be integrated into an Eclipse workspace and develop software applications incorporating the Europeana API. The original europeana4j project can be found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/europeana4j/">here</a>. The library provides a clean Java interface to the Europeana <a href="search">Search API</a>, with JavaBeans encapsulation, transparent pagination of results and utilities to copy and verify thumbnails. All code is available openly licensed and via <a href="https://github.com/europeana/europeana-client">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="repox">REPOX</h3>

<p>REPOX is a framework to manage metadata spaces developed in Java. It comprises several channels to import metadata from data providers, services to transform metadata between schemas according to user's specified rules, and services to expose the results to the exterior. REPOX aims to provide to all the TEL and Europeana partners a simple solution to import, convert and expose their bibliographic data via <a href="oai-pmh-service">OAI-PMH</a>. It was developed along EuropeanaConnect, Europeana Local, and Europeana Libraries projects. All code is available openly licensed (EUPL v.1.1) on <a href="https://github.com/europeana/REPOX">GitHub</a>.
