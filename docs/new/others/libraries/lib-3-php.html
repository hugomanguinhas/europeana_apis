<h3 id="europeana-php">Europeana PHP Library</h3>

<p>This is a PHP library for the <a href="record">Record API</a> and <a href="search">Search API</a> that was used to power an interactive documentation site. All code is available openly licensed and via <a href="https://github.com/dan-nl/europeana-api">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="colada">Colada PHP Client Library</h3>

<p>This client library for PHP was developed independently by Matthias Vandermaesen. It is a library of classes and functions which abstract Europeana's <a href="record">Record  API</a> and <a href="search">Search APIs</a>, making it easier for PHP developers to create new applications. The aim is to lower the bar for developers because they can reuse the data right away, instead of first having to figure out how to connect to these APIs.</p>

<h4>Features:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>It's a generic library, meaning that it can be reused in a plethora of popular PHP frameworks: Drupal, Laravel, Symfony, Silex, Slim PHP ...</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/">PSR-4 &amp; PSR-2</a> compliant.</li>
	<li>Uses <a href="https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle">Guzzle </a>as a HTTP client, but can be changed to other implementations via a generic Client interface.</li>
	<li>Abstracts the API to a high level 'transport - payload - response' model.</li>
	<li>JSON de/serialization via <a href="http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer">JMS Serializer</a></li>
	<li>Supports PHP 5.4 and up.</li>
	<li><a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit </a>tested.</li>
</ul>

<p>The source code and documentation is available on <a href="https://github.com/netsensei/europeana">Github</a>a&gt;, and more information about the project can be found on <a href="http://www.colada.be/implementing-the-europeana-api-in-php.html">this blog post from Matthias</a>. Matthias invites contributions from developers such as code additions, feedback, bug fixes, etc. as Github issues or pull requests.</p>

<h3>Europeana Bulk downloaders</h3>

<p>A collection of code snippets (mainly php) for working with the Europeana <a href="record">Record API</a> and <a href="search">Search API</a>. Get bulk downloads of specific subsets of items, including both their metadata and their associated media files, by using this application. Find hints and tips about how you can use these APIs to bulk download openly licensed media in our <a href="https://pro.europeana.eu/post/bulk-downloading-media-and-metadata-using-the-europeana-api">blog</a>.

<h3 id="europeana-oai">Europeana OAI-PMH Harvester</h3>

<p>This PHP script downloads all Europeana records via OAI-PMH protocol. This results in a number of files (named as europeana-oai-pmh-import-dddddddd.json), each contains 1000 records, one record per line in JSON format. Be aware: a full harvest takes more than a week and results in 250+ GB content. All code is available openly licensed and via <a href="https://github.com/pkiraly/europeana-oai-pmh-client">GitHub</a>. Also see the <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/api/oai-pmh-service">Europeana OAI-PMH documentation</a> for more information about the service.</p>
