<h3>Update</h3>

<p>The SPARQL API is powered by a separate database (Virtuoso) which reflects the current state of the Europeana datasets as in the main Europeana APIs and is regularly updated.</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>The initial pilots were set up by <a href="http://www.ontotext.com/">Ontotext</a> under the framework of the <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative">Europeana Creative</a> project and using the <a href="http://graphdb.ontotext.com/">Ontotext GraphDB</a> semantic repository (which has been replaced by Virtuoso).</p>
