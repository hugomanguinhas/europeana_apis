<p>The Record API provides direct access to the Europeana data, which is modeled using EDM. While EDM is an open flexible data model featuring various kind of resources and relations between them, the Record API (and the Europeana Collections Portal) supports the retrieval of a segment of EDM for practical purposes (a subgraph, to use strict terminology). These "atomic" EDM segments usually contain one Cultural Heritage Object (CHO), the aggregation information which connects the metadata and the digital representations together and a number of contextual resources such as the agents, places, concepts and time pertaining to the CHO.</p>

<p>Before start using this API, we recommend reading the introduction page for an overview of the EDM model, registering for an API key, and reading the <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/api-terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a>. If you want to get started with this API, go directly to the <a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a> section or try it out directly on the <a href="#console">Console</a>.</p>
