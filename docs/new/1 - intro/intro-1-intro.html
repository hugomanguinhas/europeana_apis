<p>The Europeana REST API allows you to build applications that use the wealth of our collections drawn from the major museums and galleries across Europe. Their scope includes over 50 million cultural heritage items (from books and paintings to 3D objects and audiovisual material) that celebrate over 3,500 cultural institutions across Europe.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, the Europeana REST API has grown beyond its initial scope as set out in September 2011, into a wide range of specialized APIs. At the moment, we offer several APIs that you can use to not only get the most out of Europeana but also to contribute back. If you want to search Europeana in an simple way (for instance 'give me all results for the word <i>cat</i>), you can then use the <a href="search">Search API</a>. But if you are looking for a way to delve into the structured metadata of Europeana (For instance, to ask the question "What are all the French 18th-century painters with at least five artworks available through Europeana'), then the <a href="sparql">SPARQL</a> service is more appropriate. On the other, if you have the identifier of a item in Europeana and just want to get all the metadata associated to it, then you can use the <a href="record">Record API</a>. It also possible to obtain a larger amount of metadata and ultimately the complete Europeana repository by using the <a href="oai-pmh-service">OAI-PMH Service</a>. Regarding contextual information that is associated to the items, we also offer an <a href="entity">Entity API</a> that gives you access to information such as Topics, Persons and Places. Lastly, if you want to contribute information about the items that are available on Europeana, you can do it via the <a href="annotations">Annotations API</a>.</p>
