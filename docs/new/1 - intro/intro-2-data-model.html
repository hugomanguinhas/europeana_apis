<p>To organize its data, Europeana has defined a data model named Europeana Data Model (EDM). A detailed description of EDM is beyond the scope of this documentation: the reader is referred to the extensive documentation at the <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation">EDM page</a>. However, a basic understanding of EDM is necessary for using the API. The objective of this section is to provide this basic understanding.</p>

<h3 id="edm">EDM and Records</h3>

<p>The Europeana API provides access to the Europeana data, which is modeled using EDM. While EDM is an open flexible data model featuring various kind of resources and relations between them, the Europeana API (and the Europeana Portal) supports the retrieval of a segment of EDM for practical purposes (a subgraph, to use strict terminology). These ‘atomic' EDM segments usually contain one Cultural Heritage Object (CHO), the aggregation information which connects the metadata and the digital representations together and a number of contextual resources such as the agents, places, concepts and time pertaining to the CHO. The further API documentation, in particular the <a href="#record">Record API</a> refers to this subgraph as <em>object</em>.</p>

<h3 id="identifying-records">Identifying Records</h3>

<p>Digital records delivered to Europeana are assigned a unique identifier, Europeana ID, that serves to further identify the records when using the API. Usually, this identifier is based on the original metadata that are provided for the record and internal Europeana identifiers of the provider and the dataset containing the record. For example, a Europeana ID of an object can look as follows:</p>

<p>/09102/_GNM_1234</p>

<p>where 091 is the identifier of the provider, 02 is the id of the dataset and <em>GNM_1234</em> is derived from the unique identifier of the record in the context of the provider.</p>
