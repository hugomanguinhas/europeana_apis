<p>Meaning of columns:</p>

<ul>
	<li>EDM Field: The field's name in the Europeana metadata scheme</li>
	<li>Name in search: The name we should use in search queries</li>
	<li>Datatype: The fields data type in searching</li>
	<li>Name in search result: The field's name in search call response. For some, there are different variations such as title and dcTitleLangAware which are the same but with a different structure (single value vs multi-lingual list)</li>
	<li>Name (record): The field's name in the object call response</li>
	<li>Aggregated Field/Facet: The name of aggregated fields and facets which cover this field.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ore:Aggregation</h3>

<p>An Aggregation object. The set of resources related to a single cultural heritage object that collectively represent that object in Europeana. Such set consists of: all descriptions about the object that Europeana collects from (possibly different) content providers, including thumbnails and other forms of abstractions, as well as of the description of the object Europeana builds. An aggregation is associated to the object that it is about, by the property edm:aggregatedCHO. Find more in the EDM Definition.</p>

<h3>edm:ProvidedCHO</h3>

<p>Represents the Cultural Heritage Object that Europeana collects descriptions about. The metadata describing the object sent by the data provider is described within the Provider Proxy, see the <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Share_your_data/Technical_requirements/EDM_Documentation/EDM_Primer_130714.pdf">EDM Primer</a> for the differences between edm:ProvidedCHO and Proxies.</p>

<h3>ore:Proxy (Provider and Europeana Proxies)</h3>

<p>Europeana uses Proxies as place-holders for cultural heritage objects within aggregations (whether Europeana aggregations or not) to the end of making assertions (a specific view) about the corresponding cultural heritage objects while distinguishing the provenance of these assertions. This is particular important as Europeana can add metadata which can this way be distinguished from the original metadata sent by the Data Provider (See chapter 6.1 Introducing proxies in the EDM primer). The first is usually called Europeana Provider and is distinguished from the Provider Proxy through the edm:europeanaProxy property with the value "true".</p>

<p>Differences between a Provider's Proxy and Europeana Proxy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a provider proxy has edm:type and a europeana proxy does not.</li>
	<li>a europeana proxy has edm:year and a provider proxy does not.</li>
