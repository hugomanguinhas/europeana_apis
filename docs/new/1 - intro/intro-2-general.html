<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>

<p>To start using the API you need to register for a key at the <a href="/get-api">registration page</a>. Upon registration, you will get your individual private and public authentication key. This key must then be used when calling API methods, see <a href="#access">Access using an API key</a>. We use these keys to anonymously gather relevant statistics about the usage of the API so that we can better improve it. <i>Please do not share these keys with third parties as the API keys are confidential and are for use by the client or user only.</i></p>

<p>This API key will give you access to all APIs that are in a Stable version. APIs such as OAI-PMH, Entity API, and Annotations API use different keys that can either obtained on request or use a demonstration key.</p>

<h3 id="access">Access using an API key</h3>

<p>You need to provide an access key when making a request to any of the methods made available by the API. This is done by using the wskey parameter described below. The only exception is the Thumbnail method of the Search API.</p>

<h3>Usage Limit</h3>

<p>In the past, the Europeana REST API was limited to 10.000 calls within a period of 24 hours per API key. We have lifted this restriction but may reinstate it in the future.</p>

<h3>Terms of Use</h3>

<p>Please see here our <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/api-terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<h3>API Console</h3>

<p>Each API documentation page provides a console that allows developers to easily see how the API works and test it for their needs. This is an interactive tool that allows filling method parameters in an online form and sees both the expected results and the exact format of the call that should be used by an application to get these results. The API console has been built by us for developers’ convenience. You are encouraged to use it and provide us feedback about its usability for the developer community.</p>

<h3>Releases</h3>

<p>We deploy new versions of each API quite regularly. These are minor releases in order to fix issues or make small improvements to the existing or new functionality but without breaking backwards compatibility. For major releases we follow the standard practices . </p>
