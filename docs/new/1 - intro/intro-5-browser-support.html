<p>Client application running on a web browser are typically prohibited to call methods of an endpoint that is being served under a domain outside its own because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin policy</a>. To get around this restriction, we support <a href="#CORS">CORS</a> for all the APIs that we offer. For APIs such as Record API and Search API, we still offer support for the outdated <a href="#JSONP">JSONP</a> mechanim. Given that this mechanism has been superseeded by CORS, we may stop supporting it in future versions of these APIs so <i>we strongly recommend all users to shift from JSONP to CORS</i>.</p>

<h3 id="CORS">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a> (CORS) is a transparent mechanism using HTTP headers for client applications to call APIs served from a domain outside the one they are being served. To enable CORS, it is only necessary to supply the Origin HTTP header at every request with the domain where your application is running. After handling the request, the API will respond back with a set of headers that will tell the browser to lift the restrictions.</p>

<h3 id="JSONP">JSON with padding (JSONP)</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a> (JSON with padding) is an older mechanism for getting around the same origin policy enforced by browsers. Unlike CORS, it is limited to GET request and works by supplying a client side (JavaScript) callback function that will be called with the respective response.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Under the same origin policy, a web page served from server1.example.com cannot normally connect to or communicate with a server other than server1.example.com. An exception is the HTML script element. Exploiting the open policy for script elements, some pages use them to retrieve JavaScript code that operates on dynamically generated JSON-formatted data from other origins. This usage pattern is known as JSONP. Requests for JSONP retrieve not JSON, but arbitrary JavaScript code. They are evaluated by the JavaScript interpreter, not parsed by a JSON parser." (Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A callback can be added to any JSON-based call by appending &amp;callback=callbackname to the call, where the callbackname should be an existing JavaScript function existing on the client side. The API returns JSONP response, like this one:</p>

<p>https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/record/[RECORD_ID].json?wskey=YOUR_KEY&amp;profile=similar&amp;<strong>callback=processEuropeanaSearch</strong></p>

<p>returns</p>

<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">processEuropeanaSearch({
  "apikey":"xxxxx",
  "action":"record.json",
  "success":true,
  "statsDuration":22,
  "requestNumber":8,
  "object": {
    "type":"TEXT",
    "title":["Bibliotheca Indica"],
    "about":"[record ID]",
    ...
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>The JSON response is wrapped into your function, and the function use JSON as input parameter, and it immediatelly runs when it returns. In your client you have to define the callback function before you call the API. A client side example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-HTML">&lt;script&gt;
function processEuropeanaSearch(json) {
  alert(json.object.title.join(', '));
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="http://europeana.eu/api/v2/record/0000/1111.json?wskey=xxxx&amp;callback=processEuropeanaSearch"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
