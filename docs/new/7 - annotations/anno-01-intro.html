<p>The Annotations API is an extension to the Europeana REST API which allows you to create, retrieve and manage annotations on Europeana objects. Annotations are user-contributed or system-generated enhancements, additions or corrections to (or a selection of) metadata or media. We adopted the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/" target="_blank">Web Annotation Data Model</a> as a base model for the representation of annotations and as a format for exchanging annotations between client applications and the API, but also the <a href="www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/">Web Annotation Protocol</a> as base HTTP protocol for the API.</p>

<p>Before start using this API, we recommend reading the <a href="#apikey">Registering for an API key</a> and reading the <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/api-terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a>. If you want to get started with this API, go directly to the <a href="#get-started">Getting Started</a> section or try it out directly on the <a href="#console">Console</a>. If you want to get regular updates about the Europeana API, provide feedback and discuss it with other developers, we suggest to join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/europeanaapi">Europeana API discussion group at Google Groups</a>.</p>
