<h3>Known limitation</h3>

<p>Europeana currently doesn't maintain a deleted record registry, which leads to a recommendation to re-harvest the entire collection at least every six months to ensure your copy or archive of the Europeana repository is up to date.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>Join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/europeanaapi">Europeana API discussion group at Google Groups</a> and get regular updates about the Europeana API, provide feedback and discuss it with other developers.</p>
