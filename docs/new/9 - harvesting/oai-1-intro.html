<p>The Europeana OAI-PMH service offers a way to collect large amounts of Europeana data from our repository through a <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">protocol</a> named OAI-PMH which stands for Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. The OAI-PMH protocol (presently in v2.0) allows you to harvest the entirety, or a selection, of all Europeana metadata so that it can be integrated into other services or applications.</p>

<p>To learn more about the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) and the harvesting protocol, see <a href="http://www.openarchives.org" target="_blank">http://www.openarchives.org</a> and also, an OAI for beginners tutorial from the Open Archives Forum: <a href="https://www.oaforum.org/tutorial/" target="_blank">https://www.oaforum.org/tutorial/</a></p>
