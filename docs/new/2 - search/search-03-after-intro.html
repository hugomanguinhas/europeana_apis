<h3>Roadmap and Changelog</h3>

<p>We deploy new versions of the portal and API quite regularly, but not all new versions result in changes in the interface. The current version of the Search API is 2.6.5 (2017-09-04). To see the changes made for this version and also all previous releases, see the <a href="https://github.com/europeana/api2/releases/">API changelog in the project GitHub</a>.

<h3>Backward Compatibility (v1)</h3>

<p>The current version of the Europeana API (API2) is fully backwards compatible with the previous version (API1). However, we encourage developers to switch to the new naming of the fields that were used in API v1. For more information on the mapping between the new and the old fields, please see <a href="#api1-api2-mapping">V1 to V2 Compatibility</a>.</p>
