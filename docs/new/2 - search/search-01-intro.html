  <p>The Search API provides a way to <b>search for metadata records and media</b> on the Europeana repository, for instance <i>give me all results for the word "Vermeer"</i>. Besides the ability to directly search on Europeana, this API also provides an auxiliar method for <a href="#translation">translating queries</a> and support for the <a href="#opensearch">OpenSearch.RSS</a> protocol.</p>
  
  <p>The Search API is the easiest API to use and understand. It interacts with Europeana's data in much the same way as the <a href="www.europeana.eu">Europeana portal</a> does. You can search for keywords, and the API will return all records that match that keyword. You can refine your search with more advanced queries like Boolean Searches, or you can filter out parts of the results advanced filtering. You can choose to only return objects which have certain copyright statements, and you can choose to return the results in a language of your choice. This means that with the search API, you can get a response to the query: 'Give me all objects by Vermeer that are openly licensed and have big images.'</p>

<p>If you wish to perform more advanced queries that need to <b>delve into the structured metadata</b> of Europeana (for instance, to ask the question <i>What are all the French 18th-century painters with at least five artworks available through Europeana</i>) then using the <a href="sparql">SPARQL API</a> is a better choice.<p> 


<p>Before start using this API, we recommend reading the introduction page for an overview of the EDM model, registering for an API key, and reading the <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/api-terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a>. If you want to get started with this API, go directly to the <a href="#get-started">Getting Started</a> section or try it out directly on the <a href="#console">Console</a>.</p>
