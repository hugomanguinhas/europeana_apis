The Annotations API allows you to create and retrieve user- and machine created annotations on Europeana objects.

<section>
<p>The Annotations API is an extension to the Europeana REST API which allows for the management of annotations. Annotations are user-contributed or system-generated enhancements, additions or corrections to (a selection of) metadata or media. To get straight to the point of the API, you can go directly to the <a href="/api/annotations-getting-started">Getting Started page</a> which tells you only what you have to know to start using the API.</p>
