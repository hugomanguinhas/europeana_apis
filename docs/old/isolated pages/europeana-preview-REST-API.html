Please have a look at our <a href="/api/preview-changelog/">changelog</a> for a list of all new features and API changes.</p>

<h3>Preview features</h3>

<p>The API features in the preview API are experimental and made available as a preview version first before making it available in production. The <a href="/api/preview-changelog/">changelog</a> reflects all changes, all other functionality should be the same as on the production API.</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>For the preview API you can use the same API key as you would use for the normal version of the API.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>The preview API works with a dataset of the Europeana data that is 1-3 months behind on the data you can find on the Europeana portal.</p>

<h3>API Console</h3>

<p>The API console is currently not compatible with the API preview version.</p>
