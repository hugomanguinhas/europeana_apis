The Entities API allows you to retrieve named entities from Europeana's Entity Collection.

<section>
<p>The Entities API is an API which allows you to retrieve and search for named entities. These named entities (such as persons, topics and places) are part of the Europeana Entity Collection, a collection of entities in the context of Europeana harvested from and linked to controlled vocabularies, such as â€‹<a href="http://geonames.org" target="_blank">Geonames</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org" target="_blank">Dbpedia</a> (soon also <a href="http://www.wikidata.org" target="_blank">Wikidata</a>). The Entity API is a powerful API which allows you to facilitate search on or retrieve information from named entities (within or outside the Europeana context).</p>
