The Europeana OAI-PMH Service allows you to harvest metadata using Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH v2).

<section>
<p>The Europeana OAI-PMH Service allows you to harvest metadata using Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH v2.0). The OAI-PMH Service allows you to harvest the entirety, or a selection, of all Europeana metadata, so that it can be integrated into other services or applications.</p>

<p>To learn more about the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) and the harvesting <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">protocol</a>, see <a href="http://www.openarchives.org" target="_blank">http://www.openarchives.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>Currently, the Europeana OAI-PMH Service is in beta, which means that access to the service is currently limited. If you want to start using and testing the Europeana OAI-PMH Service, you need to have an access key. Please note this is not the same as the API key for the REST API. See <a href="/api/oai-pmh-access-key">get an access key</a> for more information on how to obtain an access key.</p>

<h2>Testing the protocol</h2>

<p>You can test the Europeana OAI-PMH Service and its protocol via the OAI-cat web interface, to be found here: <a href="http://oai.europeana.eu/oaicat/" target="_blank">http://oai.europeana.eu/oaicat/</a>. Note that you do need an <a href="/api/oai-pmh-access-key">access key</a> at this point.</p>

<h2>Known limitation</h2>

<p>Europeana currently doesn't maintain a deleted record registry, which leads to a recommendation to re-harvest the entire collection at least every six months to ensure your copy or archive of the Europeana repository is up to date.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>Join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/europeanaapi">Europeana API discussion group at Google Groups</a> and get regular updates about the Europeana API, provide feedback and discuss it with other developers.</p>
