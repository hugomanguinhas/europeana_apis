Linked Open Data is a way of publishing structured data that allows metadata to be connected and enriched, so that different representations of the same content can be found, and links made between related resources. All Europeana datasets can be explored and queried through an <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api/linked-open-data-SPARQL-endpoint">SPARQL endpoint</a>.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The data.europeana.eu started as an experimental pilot in February 2012 with a small number of data providers who committed at an early stage to Europeana's initiative of promoting more open data. The project has been described in a <a href="http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/dc-2011/paper/view/55">paper</a> presented at the Dublin Core 2011 conference. In October 2012, a large subset of the Europeana’s dataset (metadata on 20 million texts, images, videos and sounds) was transformed into linked data and made available from <a href="http://data.europeana.eu/">data.europeana.eu</a>. More recently within the <a hred="http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/europeana-creative">Europeana Creative project</a>, a new pilot was developed and hosted by <a href="http://ontotext.com/">Ontotext Corp.</a> containing the full Europeana dataset at the time (metadata on about 36 million).</p>
